# Software

Hypercubing is mostly experienced through the various programs that exist to simulate higher dimensional puzzles. Below is a list of the programs and what they do.

## What program should I download?
It depends on what exactly you want to do. If you just want to solve the 3^4, then Hyperspeedcube is the way to go. If you want to explore other puzzles or dimensions, then MC4D, MPU, MC5D, MC7D is next. For Android phones and tablets, you can download MC4D from the Google Play store. If you want to go even further down the rabbit hole, there’s MagicTile, M120C, Nan Ma’s 11-cell, magic simplex 5d, MC3D.

### [Magic Cube 4D](https://superliminal.com/cube/cube.htm)
Magic Cube 4D is the original 4D puzzle program, created in 1988! It has many puzzles, including a way to make your own (although this feature is severely limited). There are a couple puzzles with some small bugs, and changing the colour scheme of a puzzle can be annoying, but this is the classic program.
 
### [Magic Cube 5D](https://www.gravitation3d.com/magiccube5d/)
Magic Cube 5D features puzzles from 2^5 through 7^5. It uses a double perspective projection, which can make it confusing to look at. For the 2^5, you have to use the buttons in the bottom right to control the puzzle.

### [Magic Cube 7D](https://superliminal.com/andrey/mc7d/)
Magic Cube 7D is where you'll find 5D, 6D, & 7D puzzles. It uses an interesting fractal design to "unwrap" the extra dimensions by making them smaller and overlap with existing dimensions. It can look really hectic at first, but once you realize that some stickers are shown multiple times, it's not that bad.

### [Magic Puzzle Ultimate](https://superliminal.com/andrey/mpu/)
Magic Puzzle Ultimate features a lot of miscellaneous puzzles, including some cuboids, 16-cell and 24-cell puzzles, and more.

### [Magic 120 Cell](http://www.gravitation3d.com/magic120cell/index.html)
Magic 120 Cell is specifically designed for the 120-cell puzzle, and as such has special piece finding filters.

### [Magic Tile](http://roice3.org/magictile/)
Magic Tile has 2D puzzles and puzzles in non-euclidean geometries

### [Nan Ma's 11-cell](https://superliminal.com/cube/ElevenCell.jar)
The 11-cell is a shape that doesn't actually exist. This puzzle is based on a theoretical abstract polytope, the 11-cell.

### [Magic Simplex 5D](https://superliminal.com/andrey/ms5d/)
Magic Simplex 5D has exclusively 5D simplices. That's it

### [Magic Cube 3D](https://github.com/rzhao271/MC3D/releases/tag/v1.0.0)
What would it be like for a 2D being to solve a 3D puzzle? Magic Cube 3D has a special mode that lets you view a 3x3x3 with "1D vision", which really makes you appreciate how we are able to solve 4D puzzles.

### [Magic Hyperbolic Tile](https://superliminal.com/andrey/mht633/)
7 different puzzles in 3D hyperbolic space. The shape of the puzzle is {6,3,3}, which means that the cells consist of hexagons at 3 to a vertex, and at 3 to an edge
