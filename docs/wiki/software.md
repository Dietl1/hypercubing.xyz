# Software

Hypercubing is mostly experienced through the various programs that exist to simulate higher dimensional puzzles. Below is a list of the programs.

## What program should I download?

It depends on what exactly you want to do. If you want the best experience for solving the n^4^, then Hyperspeedcube is the way to go.

If you want to level up to higher dimensions, then try MC5D, MC7D, MPU, and MS5D. 

If you want to try puzzles in Non-Euclidean geometries, then try Magic Tile and Magic Hyperbolic Tile.

For Android phones and tablets, you can download MC4D from the Google Play Store.
