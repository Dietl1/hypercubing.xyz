# Physical Puzzles

!!! warning
    It is highly recommended to learn virtual hypercubing first before trying to understand the physical puzzles.

Physical puzzles in the context of hypercubing refers to higher dimensional puzzles that are physically built in real life using only 3 dimensions. This often involves clever designs, strange tricks, and lots and lots of magnets. Often, these puzzles are too impractical to use, defeating their sole purpose.

For a documentary about the history of physical puzzles as of December 2022, see [Rowan's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTc-rG-nunA).

## Melinda's 2x2x2x2

[Melinda's 2x2x2x2](melinda-2222.md) was the first ever physical 4D puzzle. The pieces of it have been mass produced, meaning that you can now buy a puzzle kit, or buy it preassembled.

## Grant's 2x2x2x3

[Grant's 2x2x2x3](grant-2223.md) was the second every physical 4D puzzle. The concept design was created by Luna, and the puzzle was printed by Grant.
