## 2010-2017: Andrey's Influence

[Andrey Astrelin](https://superliminal.com/andrey/) was a Russian programmer that became known to the hypercubing community when he claimed to have programmed and solved a 3^4^ before MC4D was created in 1988. He had no proof for this, but was able to program a new simulator in only 129 lines of code, which certified his legitimacy. Andrey's main legacy came in the form of creating many programs for the community, including [Magic Puzzle Ultimate](/software/magicpuzzleultimate), Magic Cube 7D, Magic Simplex 5D, and Magic Hyperbolic Tile. These programs unlocked a massive amount of higher dimensional puzzles that were probably never seen or solved before, enriching the hypercubing community. Unfortunately Andrey passed away in 2017[^1], but his contributions to the hypercubing community will never be forgotten.

## 2017-Present: Making Physical 4D Puzzles

Throughout 2013 and 2014, Melinda Green got in contact with Oskar van Deventer to try and think of any possible mechanism for a physical 2^4^. After failing to find a reasonable physical mechanism, they ended up going with only using magnets in order to stick the hypercubies together. In 2017 the first design was finalized, and Melinda began selling the puzzles by 3D printing the parts from Shapeways. The quality of the puzzle improved in 2022 when Melinda secured a deal with a company to mass produce the pieces via injection moulding.

In late 2021, some speculation began as to if you could expand the physical 2^4^ into a physical 2x2x2x3 hypercuboid. After Rowan learned that Grant had 3D printed his own physical 2^4^, he challenged him to build a physical 2x2x2x3. Grant completed the challenge, and began designing and printing many more physical puzzles, all the way up to the physical 3x3x3x3. Many physical puzzle designs have still yet to be built...

## 2022-Present: The Hyperspeedsolving Revolution

In late 2021 [Hactar](/leaderboards/solvers/hactar) began working on the [Hyperspeedcube](/software/hyperspeedcube) program, which was a massive upgrade over older programs like MC4D. Features like piece filters and customizable keybinds were instrumental to lowering solving times. November 2022 saw the beginning of the race for the 3^4^ world record. The record was traded almost exclusively by Grant and Hactar, smashing all the barriers from sub-10 minutes all the way down to sub-2! There were also a few smaller record races for bigger layered n^4^s.

- **2022 Jan:** HSC v0.1 includes 3^3 and 3^4, filtering by piece type (not color), and customizable keybinds.
- **2022 Aug:** HSC v0.8 adds modern piece filters. HSC v0.9 adds multiple keybind sets.
