# Tutorial

## How do we make 4D puzzles?

Puzzles are (usually) based on physical geometric shapes, so you have to understand what 4D shapes there are.

Check out these resources for a deeper understanding:

- [Regular polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope)
- [Regular 4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytope)

Arguably the most important 4D shape to understand hypercubing is the hypercube/tesseract:

It has 8 sides, each of which is a cube. 3 sides meet at each vertex.

## Making puzzles out of shapes

To make [twisty puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle) out of higher dimensional shapes, we just need to define where the twists happen. Cutting a tesseract into 3 layers along each axis, we get this puzzle:
