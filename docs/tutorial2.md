## How do we make 4D puzzles?

Puzzles are (usually) based on physical geometric shapes, so you have to understand what 4D shapes there are. 4D shapes have sides, or cells, that take the form of 3D shapes, and enclose some amount of "hypervolume".

Check out these resources for a deeper understanding:

- [Regular polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope)
- [Regular 4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytope)

One of the most important 4D shapes to understand is the hypercube, as it's considered to be the main attraction of hypercubing.

A hypercube (also known as a tesseract, 8-cell, octachoron, or 4-cube) is a shape with 8 cubic sides. 3 sides meet at each edge, giving it the [Schl√§fli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) {$4,3,3$}. Watch the animation below, as the tesseract unfolds itself into its 3-dimensional net.

## Making puzzles out of shapes

To make [twisty puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle) out of higher dimensional shapes, we define cutting planes and twist axes, which will tell us which pieces go where when the puzzle is turned.
Cutting a hypercube into 3 layers along each axis, we get the 3x3x3x3, or 3^4^.
