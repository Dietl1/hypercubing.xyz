# Grip theory

Grip theory is a framework for analyzing many different kinds of twisty puzzles in a geometry-independent way. It was first developed on the TwistyPuzzles Forum in about 2010 ADD LINK. Grip theory was originally used to describe doctrinaire puzzles in 3D, but it can be extended to describe bandaged puzzles, jumbling puzzles, higher-dimensional puzzles, and more.

## Basic grip theory

### Building the 3×3×3

Consider a set of 6 abstract objects, called *grips*. We will name these grips `R`, `U`, `F`, `L`, `D`, and `B`. We can define a group that acts on this set of grips, for instance, the group generated by the 4-cycles (`R`, `U`, `L`, `D`) and (`R`, `F`, `L`, `B`). These two permutations generate a group of order 24, called the *grip group*. This is equivalent to the symmetry group of the cube, where the grips correspond to the corresponding faces of the cube, but by defining this system without reference to the cube, it can be replaced with other non-geometric objects.

In grip theory, a *piece* will be defined to have two things: its *attitude*, which is an element of the grip group, and a set of *active grips*. For instance, a piece could be in the identity attitude (we call this *solved*) and have the active grip set {`R`, `U`}. There are several ways to transform a piece by rotating its attitude, and when this happens, the active grip set is defined to follow it. Thus, two pieces are defined to be equal if when you rotate the pieces' attitudes to solved, the active grips are identitcal. Thus, we can decompose the attitude into two components: the *position* of the piece, which is its current active grip set, and the *orientation* of the piece, which is its attitude modulo position.

A *twist* has two components: the grip we twist around, or *axis*, and an element of the grip group that fixes that grip, the *transformation*. To apply a twist to a piece, we first check if the grip of the twist is an active grip of the piece. If it is not, the piece remains unchanged. Otherwise, we apply the twist's transformation to the attitude of the piece. The active grip set is considered attached to the attitude and turns with it. For instance, consider the twist with axis `U` and transformation (`R`, `F`, `L`, `B`), which fixes `U`. We will apply this to the piece from above, so the attitude of the piece is changed to (`R`, `F`, `L`, `B`). In the active grip set, `U` is kept stationary, but `R` is moved to `F`, so the new active grip set is {`U`, `F`}.

We can look at the set of all possible twists. In this case, there are 6 possible axis grips, and 4 possible transformations for each axis, though one of each is the identity and will do nothing to the pieces. The set of all positions our piece can move to are all sets of two grips except {`R`, `L`}, {`U`, `D`}, and {`F`, `B`}. These exactly correspond to the edge positions of the 3×3×3. An edge piece is only affected by a twist if one of its colored faces is on the face corresponding to the axis of the twist, and after the twist, the positions of its colored faces moves. This is exactly the behavior of the active grips. Therefore, the piece above is an edge piece. We can similarly construct three more sets of pieces: the corners, with active grips like {`R`, `U`, `F`}, the centers, which active grips like {`R`}, and the core, with empty active grip set. Note that even though the centers have only one grip, they still have attitude, so the centers on this puzzle are actually super centers. Thus, we have built the 3×3×3.

### Complex puzzles

We do not need to be limited to the pieces that exist on the physical 3×3×3. We can take every subset of the grip set, which has $2^6 = 64$ pieces. The puzzle you get when you include all the pieces of another puzzle in this sense is called the *complex* version of that puzzle. 

The complex 3×3×3 has 10 types of pieces, which include the core, centers, edges, and corners from the 3×3×3. It also includes the axles, with active grips like {`R`, `L`}, and the bridges, with active grips like {`R`, `U`, `L`}. The other types of pieces are generated by the *anti-* automorphism of this puzzle. The anti- automorphism takes the active grip set of each piece of the solved puzzle its complement. It takes each twist the composition of two actions of the puzzle: the first action is a rotation of every piece with the twist's transformation, and the second is a new twist whose grip is the opposite of the twist's grip (where the opposite is defined as on a cube), and whose transformation is the inverse of the twist's grip. When viewed on an actual 3×3×3, this automorphism maps moves to wide moves. The anti- version of a piece is the image of a piece under the anti- automorphism. Thus, we can call the other pieces of the complex 3×3×3 anti-edges, anti-axles, anti-centers, and the anti-core. Anti-corners and anti-bridges are isomorphic to the corners and bridges, so they do not need to be recounted.
