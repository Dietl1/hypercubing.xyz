# Physical 2x2x2x2 Canonical Moves & Notation

!!! info
    Watch [Melinda Green's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch/DzRH8BOJL8Q) for a quick overview of the canonical moves

The Canonical Moveset is a set of moves agreed upon by the community for solving the physical 2^4^. To get accepted into the official [Hall of Fame](https://superliminal.com/cube/2x2x2x2/#solutions) for solving the puzzle, you **must** follow the canonical moves exactly.

    Because this puzzle is physically in 3-dimensional space, we can easily adapt the tandard x y z rotations for our notation.

## Cell Twists

The most obvious place to start is by twisting the 2 cubic halves of the puzzle. From the standard orientation of white top, green front, purple inside, the left cell is orange and right cell is red. You can twist these 2 halves just like a cube, into any reorientation.

Each move here either starts with an L or an R, followed by the rotations (separated by commas). You could technically string it any way you like (for example if you did Lx2,y2 in a solve then you can write it that way), however a cube only has 24 different orientations.

Left cell twists: Ly, Ly', Ly2, Lx2, Lz2, Lx2,y, Lx2,y', Lx, Lx,y, Lx,y', Lx,y2, Lx', Lx',y, Lx',y', Lx',y2, Lz, Lz,y, Lz,y', Lz,y2, Lz', Lz',y, Lz',y', Lz',y2

Right cell twists: Ry, Ry', Ry2, Rx2, Rz2, Rx2,y, Rx2,y', Rx, Rx,y, Rx,y', Rx,y2, Rx', Rx',y, Rx',y', Rx',y2, Rz, Rz,y, Rz,y', Rz,y2, Rz', Rz',y, Rz',y', Rz',y2


## Inside/Outside Twists

The inside cell is the side with the next most turning freedom after L and R. This was referred to as an "axial twist" in Melinda's video. The only canonical move for the inside cell is Ix* (Ix, Ix', and Ix2). This is kind of difficult to fingertrick, so most people split it up into 2 illegal twists (if it were a 2x2x4, then it would be 2 90 degree twists like L R').

You can also turn the Outside cell in the exact same way.

## Slab Twists

The remaining canonical twists involve picking up a 2x2x4 "slab" off the puzzle, and rotating it 180 degrees in the same plane. These slabs you can pick up are the U, F, D, and B cells. Because the slabs can only be turned 180 degrees those moves will just be referred to as U2, F2, D2, and B2. 


## Gyro

If you try to scramble the puzzle with all the moves above, you will quickly notice that the 2 colours on the x-axis aren't mixing with the other colours.

The gyro is a loose term that refers to special 4D puzzle rotations that change a certain axis so that you can use different moves. Without using a gyro, there's nothing you can do to change what stickers are on the x-axis.

There are several different algorithms for this, some of which gyro different axes. Melinda has several videos about different gyro algorithms, the shortest known one being 6 snaps. Below is a common gyro algorithm that several people in the community use.

- Take the left endcap off and put it on the right so it becomes the right endcap (this brings the puzzle into the inverted state)
- Ly Ry'
- Take the right endcap off and put it on the left so it becomes the left endcap (this brings the puzzle back into the normal state)
- Rx2 B2 D2 Lx2

!!! note
    Note that the last 2 moves (D2 Lx2) could be replaced by D2 Rx2, U2 Lx2, or U2 Rx2 based on the solver's preference.
    Watch [Melinda's 6 Snap Gyro] for an alternative algorithm. 

# Expanded Canonical Moveset

The expanded moveset is what is accepted for the Hypercubing.xyz leaderboards. These moves all correspond perfectly with twists on the [virtual puzzle](/puzzles/2x2x2x2), but weren't allowed in the canonical moveset because people agreed not to for some reason.

## Extra slab twists

## Extra I/O cell twists

Iz2, Iy2, Oz2, and Oy2 are added (although they are very hard to fingertrick and perform quickly).
