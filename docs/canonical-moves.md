# Physical 2x2x2x2 Canonical Moves & Notation

The Canonical Moveset is a set of moves agreed upon by the community for solving the physical 2^4^. You are only allowed to do these moves for Hall of Fame submissions, so make sure to stick to this moveset carefully!

Because this puzzle is physically in 3-dimensional space, we can easily adapt x y z rotations to make notation.

## Cell Twists

The most obvious place to start is by twisting the 2 cubic halves of the puzzle. From the standard orientation of white top, green front, purple inside, the left cell is orange and right cell is red. You can twist these 2 halves just like a cube, into any reorientation.

Each move here either starts with an L or an R, followed by the rotations (separated by commas). You could technically string it any way you like (for example if you did Lx2,y2 in a solve then you can write it that way), however a cube only has 24 different orientations.

Left cell twists: Ly, Ly', Ly2, Lx2, Lz2, Lx2,y, Lx2,y', Lx, Lx,y, Lx,y', Lx,y2, Lx', Lx',y, Lx',y', Lx',y2, Lz, Lz,y, Lz,y', Lz,y2, Lz', Lz',y, Lz',y', Lz',y2

Right cell twists = Ry, Ry', Ry2, Rx2, Rz2, Rx2,y, Rx2,y', Rx, Rx,y, Rx,y', Rx,y2, Rx', Rx',y, Rx',y', Rx',y2, Rz, Rz,y, Rz,y', Rz,y2, Rz', Rz',y, Rz',y', Rz',y2





Because this is a physical puzzle, . The puzzle is held horizontally throughout most of the solve, so the L and R cells can do any x, y, & z rotations freely. The I and O cells can do any x rotation, as well as only y2 or z2 rotations. The other sides have restricted turning due to the projection, and can only do 180 degree twists, so they will just be referred to as U2, D2, F2, B2. 




## Gyro

If you try to scramble the puzzle with all the moves above, you will quickly notice that the 2 colours on the x-axis aren't mixing with the other colours.

The gyro is a loose term that refers to special 4D puzzle rotations that change a certain axis so that you can use different moves. Without using a gyro, there's nothing you can do to change what stickers are on the x-axis

There are several different algorithms to gyro, some of which "gyro" different axes. Melinda has several videos about different gyro algorithms, the shortest known of which being 6 snaps.

- Take the left endcap off and put it on the right so it becomes the right endcap (this brings the puzzle into the inverted state)
- Ly Ry'
- Take the right endcap off and put it on the left so it becomes the left endcap (this brings the puzzle back into the normal state)
- Rx2 B2 D2 Lx2

!!! note
    Note that the last 2 moves (D2 Lx2) could be replaced by D2 Rx2, U2 Lx2, or U2 Rx2 based on the solver's preference.
    Watch [Melinda's 6 Snap Gyro] for an alternative algorithm.
