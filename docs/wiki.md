# Wiki

Learn everything hypercubing, including history, software, puzzles, methods, tutorials, tecniques, algorithms, articles, and more!

## Goals
Hypercubing is a very niche sub-branch within the already niche hobby of cubing. This makes finding information on it very difficult. The goal of this wiki is to compile all of our collective hypercubing knowledge into one location, so that anyone can find what they're looking for with ease.

## Where to Start
