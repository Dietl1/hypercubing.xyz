## History

[Tymon F](https://hypercubing.xyz/leaderboards/solvers/tymofro/) began some initial tests for this puzzle in October 2023. The first 2 pieces were fully assembled and magnetized by December 2023. Finally (conincidentally exactly 1 year after he discovered hypercubing), Tymon completed the 2x2x2x1 hypercuboid on 2024-01-11. He is currently working his way up to a 3x3x3x1 puzzle.

## Moves

Legal moves include normal 2x2x2 moves, as well as rotating a layer by 180Â° in any plane, effectively mirroring it from our 3D perspective.
