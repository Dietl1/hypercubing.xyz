    **4D Shape:** Penteract

    **Physical Shape:** Rectangular prism

    **Pieces:** 32 5c

    **Magnets:** 768 (without buffer)

The restricted 2x2x2x2x2 or 2^5^ (also called the physical domino reduced 2x2x2x2x2) is a physical puzzle that represents the state space of a virtual 2^5^ puzzle, with one of the axes only being able to do 180 degree turns. This puzzle is like the 5D equivalent of scrambling a 2^3^ with only `<U,D,R2,F2,L2,B2>`, which makes the solve way easier than the non-restricted version.

The first known restricted 2^5^ was made by [Grant Staten](/leaderboards/solvers/grant/) which he showed off in a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmTx-YI9NWM). [Hyperespy](/leaderboards/solvers/hyperespy/) also made a version using foldable paper cubes to cover the pieces.

## Pieces and Twists

There are 32 5c pieces, but each piece can only be oriented in 12 ways instead of 60 because of the axis restriction. And just like [Melinda's physical 2^4^](/puzzles/physical/2x2x2x2/), this puzzle has certain legal moves that a solver must follow. 8 buffer pieces are often used to separate the 2 sides on the reduced axis to make it more obvious if you were to do an illegal move.




## How to make one

[Order a 2^4^](https://superliminal.com/cube/2x2x2x2/ordering.html) DIY kit from Melinda Green. Then assemble it with a mirrored colour scheme from your current 2^4^, but with the same magnet layout. For the 5D stickers 192 are needed in total, with half (96) of them being black and the other half grey. This means that each normal physical 2^4^ piece gets 6 stickers on it. If you have good vinyl sticker paper to use, that's a great choice. Another good option is to order a couple of custom sticker sets online such as [these](https://www.thecubicle.com/products/gan330-keychain-sticker-set).

If you want to add buffer pieces, you need 8 monocolored hypercubies with a custom magnet layout.
