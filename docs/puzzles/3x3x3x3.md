    **Shape:** Tesseract

    **Pieces:** 8 1c, 24 2c, 32 3c, 16 4c

The 3×3×3×3 (normally referred to as the 3^4^) is a 4-dimensional twisty puzzle in the shape of a hypercube that has 2 cuts along each of the 4 axes. It is a direct higher dimensional analogy of the 3×3×3 Rubik's Cube.

The 3^4^ is recommended as one's first introduction to solving higher dimensional puzzles.

## Pieces

The 3^4^ has 81 hypercubies, of which 72 are movable. It has 8 1c, 24 2c, 32 3c, and 16 4c pieces. The 3c pieces can be rotated in 6 different ways, and the 4c pieces in 12 different ways.

## Turning

Each turn of the 3^4^ is a rotation of one of its cubic cells (which can be oriented in any of 24 orientations of a cube). A normal move disturbs 8 4c, 12 3c, and 4 2c pieces.

## History

The 3^4^ has always been the main focus of the community. The first solve was done by Don Hatch in ~1988 using [MC4D](/software/magiccube4d.md). After that, the Hall of Fame gradually began to increase in size. It eventually closed on December 7th, 2022 due to it reaching 500 solvers.

## Permutations

The 16 4cs of the 3×3×3×3 can be placed in any even permutation. Each 4c can be placed in $\frac{4!}{2}$ orientations, except the last, which can be placed in only $4$ orientations, due to the existence of monoflip. The 32 3cs can be in any permutation, and can have $3!$ orientations, except the last, which can only have $3$. The 24 2cs can be in any permutation, and can have $2!$ orientations, except the last, which is determined by the others. However, the permutation parity of the 2cs and 3cs are linked. Thus, the number of permutations of the puzzle is
$\left[\frac{16!}{2} \cdot \left(\frac{4!}{2}\right)^{15} \cdot 4\right] \cdot \left[32! \cdot 3!^{31} \cdot 3\right] \cdot \left[\frac{24!}{2} \cdot 2!^{23}\right] \approx 1.76 \cdot 10^{120}.$

### Monoflip

The monoflip is the phenomenon where a single corner piece on the 3×3×3×3 can be flipped in place, with two 2-swaps of stickers, while all other corners are solved. Conversely, if 15 corners on the puzzle are solved, the last corner must either be solved or in one of 3 orientations of the monoflip. This effect is unique to 4D hypercubes. In 3D, having 7 solved corners implies the last corner must also be solved, and in 5D and above, the orientation of the last corner is independent of the orientations of the others.

The monoflip exists because the group of orientations of a single corner, ignoring others, is $A_4$, and its commutator subgroup is the Klein four-group $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$. Each element of this group corresponds to either the identity or a monoflip. Its quotient in $A_4$ is $\mathbb{Z}_3$, which represents an invariant analogous to total corner twist in 3D. This will allow us to prove that the orientation of the last corner, given that the other 15 are solved, must be identity or monoflip.

First, we construct a particular set of 8 ridges by choosing two sets of 4 parallel ridges which are mutually orthogonal (for instance, choose two disjoint rings of 4 cells each, and select the ridges which lie between two cells of the same ring). We say these ridges are red. We can take two more sets of 8 ridges the same way both disjoint from the first one, and we call those ridges green and blue. Notice that if we perform a monoflip on a corner colored like this, the arrangement of colors does not change.

If we pick a particular corner position, we can call its position even. Then, we specify that positions adjacent to even positions are odd, and positions adjacent to odd positions are even. This is well-defined and unique given our original choice. Coordinate-wise, if the coordinates of the corners are in $\{-1,1\}^4$, corners whose coordinates have product $1$ can be even and those with product $-1$ can be odd. Then, in any position of the 3×3×3×3, we define the variant of a particular corner based on two factors: the color in the solved position of where the red ridge of the corner is, and whether the position of the corner is even or odd.

|       | Even | Odd |
| ----- | ---- | --- |
| Red   | 0    | 0   |
| Green | 1    | 2   |
| Blue  | 2    | 1   |

In effect, in an odd position, the roles of green and blue are swapped. By adding the variant of each corner, we get the invariant of the position.

We now analyze how the invariant changes under turns. Since quarter turns form a generating set, we only need to consider those. Each quarter turn fixes one color of ridge and swaps the other two. It also takes corners in even positions to odd positions and vice versa, which swaps blue and green (for the purposes of computing the variant). Thus, it effectively either keeps all colors fixed or 3-cycles them. This has the effect of adding $k$ to the variants of even-positioned corners and subtracting $k$ from the odd-positioned corners for some $k \in \mathbb{Z}_3$. Thus, the invariant stays fixed. Since the invariant of the solved position is $0$, it is $0$ in any position and so if 15 corners are solved, the last one can only be in a variant-$0$ position, that is, identity or monoflip.

## Speedsolving

(See the [leaderboards](/leaderboards/index.md) for the current records)

There were a few hypercube speedsolving competitions during the early days of hypercubing, with the controversy at the time being if they were to allow macros or not. One of the first competitions happened in 2010, with the fastest time being 15:57 by Mateusz Burnicki (using prepared macros)
Some contestants recieved a t-shirt with an image of the 3^4^ in MC4D on it.

In mid 2017, The speedsolving scene was single handedly revived by [Tetrian22](https://www.youtube.com/@Timebug22), lowering his best from 37:07 to 10:11 in just under 10 months.

Starting in November 2022, a 3^4^ speedsolving frenzy began due to the popularity of the recently created [Hyperspeedcube](/software/hyperspeedcube.md) program, and its keyboard controls. The record bounced between Hactar and Grant as it smashed through all the barriers, finally lowering to sub-2 minutes in May 2023.
