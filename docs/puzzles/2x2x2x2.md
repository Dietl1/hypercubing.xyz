## History

The 2x2x2x2 (normally referred to as the 2^4^) is a 4-dimensional twisty puzzle in the shape of a hypercube that is cut in half on each of the 4 axes.

The first official 2^4^ solve on the [Hall of Fame](https://superliminal.com/cube/halloffame.htm) was done by [Jay Berkenbilt](https://www.ql.org/q/) in 2004 using [MC4D](/software/magiccube4d), although it was probably solved several times before that.
