    **Shape:** [Hemi-dodecahedron](https://polytope.miraheze.org/wiki/Hemidodecahedron)

    **Pieces:** 6 1c, 15 2c, 10 3c

## History

The hemimegaminx is a twisty puzzle in the shape of a hemi-dodecahedron. In MagicTile, it inhabits the projective plane.

The puzzle can be constructed by identifying opposite faces on a megaminx. On this realization of the puzzle, opposite faces will turn in opposite directions. In order to be a true hemimegaminx, opposite faces should also be colored the same, so the puzzle will have 6 colors total.

## Permutations

The 10 3cs of the hemimegaminx can be placed in any even permutation. Each 4c can be placed in $3!$ orientations, except the last, which can be placed in only $3$ orientations. The 15 2cs can be placed in any even permutation, and each one has $2$ orientations, except the last, whose orientation is determined by the other pieces. Thus, the number of permutations of the puzzle is
$\left[\frac{10!}{2} \cdot 3!^{9} \cdot 3\right] \cdot \left[\frac{15!}{2} \cdot 2^{14}\right] \approx 5.87 \cdot 10^{29}.$

## Physical version

In 2019, after several prototypes, Oskar van Deventer built the [first working hemimegaminx](https://twistypuzzles.com/app/museum/museum_showitem.php?pkey=7856). In 2024, Akkei created another physical hemimegaminx and did the first known timed solve on it.
