## History

Many hypercubers, including [Melinda Green](https://superliminal.com/) (one of the developers of MC4D) wanted to create a physical 3^4^, but it just seemed too complicated. Eventually, Melinda decided to focus on the 2^4^ because it only has 16 pieces (4c pieces).

Throughout 2013 and 2014, Melinda was in contact with [Oskar van Deventer](https://oskarvandeventer.nl/), and together they tried to think of any possible mechanism for a physical 2^4^. After much trouble trying to design a 2^4^ in 3D space, Melinda settled on using magnets as a mechanism. In 2017, Melinda built the first prototype and shared an unlisted [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Asx653BGDWA) showing it off to the mailing list members. 

Matthew Sheerin pointed out that the magnet configuration wouldn't be enough to support the puzzle after a 4D rotation, so Melinda had to double the amount of magnets in each piece.

In April 2017, Melinda built a 2nd prototype using 3D printing from a company called Shapeways (which just so happened to offer 8 colors, 6 of them being standard Rubikâ€™s Cube colors, plus pink and purple (this is where the standard 4D colour scheme comes from)).

In December of 2017, Melinda made a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D4m1Kit3TI) fully explaining the puzzle, including its canonical moves, scrambling, and more.

The pieces of the 2x2x2x2 were mass produced in 2022. The newest version feels super nice and high quality, like a high end GAN cube.

## How Does it Work?

It was obvious that you could rotate the 2 cubic sides in any way you wanted. Gradually (through mailing list community consensus) the move set was narrowed down to just a couple of moves, plus a gyro (4D rotation). Watch Melinda's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DzRH8BOJL8Q) on the official canonical moves.
