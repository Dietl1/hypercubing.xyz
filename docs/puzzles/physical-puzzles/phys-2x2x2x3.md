Grant's 2x2x2x3 is a physical 4D twisty puzzle that was designed and 3D printed by [Grant S](/leaderboards/solvers/grant/). It works almost the same to its virtual counterpart, with the restrictions of only certain moves being canonical, plus the extra gyro algorithms needed to rotate the puzzle 4 dimensionally.

## History

In December of 2021, Melinda green posted this image to the Hypercubers Discord server, jokingly calling it a 2x2x2x3:

After Melinda posted that, Luna started sketching out some ideas of possible layouts for an actual 2x2x2x3.

She invented the design for the 3c pieces by dividing the edges of a cube into 12 sections like this, grouping 4 sets of 3 together symmetrically.

This is when Grant joined the server, and shared his 3D printed 2x2x2x2. Rowan then challenged him to build Luna's design for the 2x2x2x3. After a lot of time tweaking the designs, printing them, magnetizing them, and assembling them, the 2x2x2x3 was completed on February 3rd 2022.

## How Does it Work?

It follows the same basic principles as [Melinda's 2x2x2x2](/puzzles/physical-puzzles/phys-2x2x2x2), except gyros get more complicated. Grant made a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7on6xk9kq-g) showing off the legal twists, and how it matched the virtual puzzle in MPU exactly.
