# Square Prism

_Hactar & Luna, 2024-04-15_

Master Nazir was working on a new puzzle, a novel cut of a square-pentagon duoprism, when he noticed Neophyte Sama standing awkwardly, as though she were waiting for something.

"Do you have a question for me?" Master Nazir asked, not bothering to look up from his dihedral angle calculations.

"Y- yes. Master, what is this shape? I did not know a 4-dimensional shape could be constructed only from cubes and pentagonal prisms."

"You recognize cubes in this shape?"

"Are these cells not cubes? They appear to be cubes."

Master Nazir stood up from his work and gestured around. The puzzle workshop extended quite far in all directions, and several monks from other temples were working on other designs throughout the room.

He asked, "Is this room a cube?"

"It certainly appears to be, if the ceiling is as tall as the length of the wall."

"Are you able to measure it?"

"No."

"Why not?"

"I cannot walk on the wall."

"And yet you stand on the floor."

_At that moment, Sama was enlightened._
