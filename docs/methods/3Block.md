# 3Block

3-Block is a method designed for quickly speedsolving the 3^4. Many speesolving world records have been set using this method. It was primarily invented by Luna and HactarCE, and has been described as "ZZ without EO". It is most analogous to the 3^3 method FreeFOP, which omits a single cross piece in order to let you pair things easier.

Using this method results in 300-400 move long solves (STM).

## Summary of the Method 

- 4/6 Cross: Solve 4 out of 6 cross pieces.
- Mid: Solve 4 2c3c pairs betwen the 4 cross pieces.
- Left: Blockbuild or pair pieces to solve the Left Cell.
- Right: Blockbuild or pair pieces to solve the Right Cell.

## Method

### 4/6 Cross
Solve 4 out of the 6 cross pieces (in a ring), with the cross colour being on the O cell. The unsolved cross pieces will be on the Left and Right.

### Mid
!!! tip
    For the entirety of F2L, the last layer is held on the I cell, as opposed to [CFOP](CFOP.md) where it is held on the U cell. This allows us to see more information at once.

Create and insert 4 F2L-a (2c3c) pairs into the 4/6 cross. This will solve 2/3 of the M slice. Because the Left and Right cells don't have their cross pieces, you can use them to aid with building and inserting the pairs.

### Left
Solve the Left cell. This is done in 3 blocks, hence the name of the method. The first block consists of the cross edge, followed by two 2c3c F2L-a pairs that are opposite of each other. This solves the middle column of the left cell. The final two blocks consist of a 2c3c pair, and two 3c4c pairs.

### Right
Solve the Right cell. This is also done by breaking it up into the 3 blocks, except now you don't have an empty opposite cell to aid you in making pairs. You could just solve the cross edge, and then finish the whole solve using [CFOP](CFOP.md) style F2L and Last Cell. You can also do it the 3 blocks way, except having less freedom means that it is slightly trickier to set up the correct cases.
 
### Last Cell
This is done in the exact same way as [CFOP](/methods/CFOP/#2colc.md).
