# Cell by Cell

Cell by Cell is the 4D equivalent of Layer by Layer.


## 1. Solve the first cell

Completely solve one of the sides of the puzzle. You can do this by blockbuilding, or by getting all the same color one on side and then using RKT to permute the pieces around until they are solved.

## 2. Solve the last cell

### a. Orient the last cell

Orient the last cell by using RKT to set up OCLL cases, and then using RKT to perform those algorithms.

### b. Permute the last cell

Permute the last cell like a 2^3^ using RKT. You may run into RKT parity in this step, or you can avoid it by using certain last layer algorithms.
