# Big Cube Reduction

!!! info "Not to be confused with [Dimensional Reduction](/techniques/dimensional-reduction)"

Just like 3D reduction of big cubes, 4D reduction works by pairing up successive groups of pieces with more and more colors. For example if you were reducing 4^6^ to 3^6^, you would pair in the order 1c, 2c, 3c, 4c, and then 5c.
