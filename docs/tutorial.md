## What is a dimension?

The dimensionality of an object or space is the number of coordinates needed to describe its position. First, think of a 1-dimensional number line. To describe a position on the number line, all you need is one set of numbers for the coordinate. In 2-dimensional space like a graph, you need 2 sets of numbers to represent a point, such as $(3,4)$. This continues on to higher dimensions, where you need more and more numbers in order to locate a point.

!!! warning "Common Misconception"
    The 4th dimension is **NOT** time. In a hypercubing context, higher dimensions refer to spatial dimensions, not temporal dimensions. Time is a different type of dimension because we can't move around in it in the same way we can for a spatial dimension.

The reason why it's so difficult to comprehend higher dimensions is that we can't see them in the same way we can see the normal 3 dimensions. In fact, humans technically only see in 2D, it's just that having 2 eyes allows for parallax and depth perception. When we show 3D shapes on a 2D computer monitor, they are getting *projected* into 2 dimensions. There are many types of [spatial projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection), and different ways to view higher dimensions, which only further obfuscates the understanding.

## How do we make 4D puzzles?

Puzzles are (usually) based on physical geometric shapes, so you have to understand what 4D shapes there are. 4D shapes have sides, or cells, that take the form of 3D shapes, and enclose some amount of "hypervolume".

Check out these resources for a deeper understanding:

- [Regular polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_polytope)
- [Regular 4-polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_4-polytope)

One of the most important 4D shapes to understand is the hypercube, as it's considered to be the main attraction of hypercubing.

A hypercube (also known as a tesseract, 8-cell, octachoron, or 4-cube) is a shape with 8 cubic sides. 3 sides meet at each edge, giving it the [Schl√§fli symbol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schl%C3%A4fli_symbol) {$4,3,3$}. Watch the animation below, as the tesseract unfolds itself into its 3-dimensional net.

## Making puzzles out of shapes

To make [twisty puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle) out of higher dimensional shapes, we define cutting planes and twist axes, which will tell us which pieces go where when the puzzle is turned.
Cutting a hypercube into 3 layers along each axis, we get the 3x3x3x3, or 3^4^.
