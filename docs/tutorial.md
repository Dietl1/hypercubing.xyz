## What is a dimension?

The dimensionality of an object or space is the number of coordinates needed to describe its position. First, think of a 1-dimensional number line. To describe a position on the number line, all you need is one set of numbers for the coordinate. In 2-dimensional space like a graph, you need 2 sets of numbers to represent a point, such as $(3,4)$. This continues on to higher dimensions, where you need more and more numbers in order to locate a point.

!!! warning "Common Misconception"
    - The 4th dimension is **NOT** time. In a hypercubing context, higher dimensions refer to spatial dimensions, not temporal dimensions. Time is a different type of dimension because we can't move around in it in the same way we can for a spatial dimension.

The reason why it's so difficult to comprehend higher dimensions is that we can't see them in the same way we can see the normal 3 dimensions. In fact, humans technically only see in 2D, it's just that having 2 eyes allows for parallax and depth perception. When we show 3D shapes on a 2D computer monitor, they are getting *projected* into 2 dimensions. There are many types of [spatial projections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_projection), and different ways to view higher dimensions, which only further obfuscates the understanding.
