# Hypercubing

Hypercubing is a niche branch of cubing that focuses on solving [twisty puzzles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-dimensional_sequential_move_puzzle) that exist in more than 3 dimensions. A 4D Rubik's Cube, also known as a tesseract, is a dimensional extension of the 3D Rubik's Cube. It has 8 sides, each of which is shaped like a cube. But there are loads of other 4D, 5D, 6D, and even 7D puzzles you can play with!
